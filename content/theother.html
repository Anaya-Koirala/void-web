            <p>The film Wall-E, released in 2008, presents a dystopian future where the Earth has been ravaged by the perils of consumerism, greed, and climate change. Consequently, humanity has evacuated to a spacecraft known as the Axiom, leaving behind only a swarm of garbage-collecting robots. The movie ends with a bright and hopeful tone of "everything will be fine if we all work together," a trope of modern media. It declares itself as a critique of environmental degradation, corporate greed, and rampant consumerism. It doesn't employ metaphors nor is it an allegorical journey; rather, Wall-E's criticism is straightforward enough to be understood by the general public.
                This movie is a perfect representation of ideology in our world. A movie being produced by The Walt Disney Corporation, the same Corporation that is the pinnacle of modern consumerism and corporate greed. The corporation thrives on consumerism, producing huge amounts of disposable plastic waste while capitalizing on society's nostalgia. It is able to mask itself as a family-friendly company that "cares about you" and "loves diversity, LGBT, Black People". Disneyland, its greatest triumph, epitomizes the concept of hyperreality, where the boundaries between the real and the simulated blur. I assume the reader knows much more about the Walt Disney Corporation than I have described. In short, Disney is not so much different from the corporations in the movie.
                Here we must ask a few questions...<br><br>
                <b>Why did Disney even make this movie?<br /></b>
                <b>Why did such a successful movie not change anything?</b><br /><br>
                To answer these questions, we must dive deep into the heart of modern ideology. We must think about how we perceive and treat "the foreign," "the alien," and "the evil". We must question the very existence of "the different".
                I implore the reader to ponder, to question, to push the very boundary of your reason and core beliefs. Our future and freedom depend on it.
                <br /><br />
                Perhaps, the greatest achievement of mass media (and thereby modern-day capitalism) has been the neutralization and pacification of its greatest threats. We have been so engulfed in the signs, symbols, and spectacles of modern-day media that we ourselves have been pacified. Despite the overwhelming evidence of climate change, we merely acknowledge its existence without taking decisive action. We have become desensitized, accepting it as just another facet of media. This is the same with the movie Wall-E.
                Ultimately, the film became a commodity, an aesthetic fixture, something unreal despite its unequivocal message being very much grounded in reality. The true extent of the movie was to become just another spectacle. The same can be said with Amazon selling the Communist Manifesto or <a href='../static/che_img.png'>this rolex ad</a>. Cultural products and experiences become stripped of their deeper meaning and social implications. They are reduced to passive consumption. Regardless of how radical "the other" is, it becomes a spectacle, a subset of the dominant ideology.
                Martin Luther King Jr. During his lifetime, he was regarded as a threat, something to be eradicated, yet today he has been neutralized, transformed into a symbol for both the left and the right in the United States. He has been molded to fit each ideology's agenda. We now live in a hyperreality - a world so detached from the truth and the real. Everything has been a flawed copy of a copy. He has been so distorted and bent to fit each person's ideology that we have killed the real MLK. MLK in his own words heavily critiqued capitalism and even had a lot of socialist views, yet this is not the MLK that exists now. To progress beyond our own ideologies, we must transcend the allure of spectacles and perceive the other as not merely an object of fascination, but as a potential threat. Only through this approach can we grow as individuals and attain genuine freedom.
