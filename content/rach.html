                In the expanse of the classical repertoire, Rachmaninov's illustrious 2nd Piano Concerto reigns supreme, captivating hearts worldwide with its profound emotional resonance. As an enthusiast, I had encountered this piece, yet it never managed to touch me like Chopin, until a recent transformative encounter. Immersed in a scenic ambiance, I embarked on a solitary journey through this piece of music where its true essence and beauty opened before my soul, moving me to the brink of tears. Rachmaninov weaves beauty, elegance, and virtuosity into this masterpiece seamlessly, resulting in a majestic work of art that takes the listener on a journey through failure, struggle, and finally triumph and victory.

                Yet before I talk about the music itself, I find it essential to discuss the artist himself and the context behind this music. Rachmaninov was a multifaceted artist, a virtuosic pianist, an expressive composer, and a passionate human being. The disastrous premiere of his first symphony left him depressed and his up-and-coming career in shambles. Only through the psycho-hypnotic therapy of Nikolai Dahl (to whom this piece is dedicated) was he able to recover from this state and save his career from that of a failed composer to that of a famous pianist and composer.

                The first bars of the first movement commence with the piano, solitary and alone, playing slow and haunting chords, like the echoes of a monumental tragedy still haunting the soul. The strings then enter with a mournful melody, accompanied by the piano's arpeggiated frenzy, intensifying the sense of tragedy and mystery; enough to give goosebumps. The music then transforms into a gentler theme; but only for a moment before the music gathers momentum once again and ends in a haunting motif of the first theme.

                The second movement unfolds with the tender embrace of slow strings accompanied by the piano's beautiful voice. Here the wind section plays a sublime yet heartbreaking melody. It echoes a stoic spirit; that of accepting the tragedy and suffering of the world and nevertheless moving forward with courage and love for the world. Another climax is reached, yet this climax feels different; it's not a climax of tragedy and loss, rather, it's a celebration of triumph and victory, a celebration of the human spirit, a life-affirming music. For me, it is also about the connection with nature itself. The wind section reminds me of the slowly falling leaves over a green hill. The wind blowing over the sunset, and the realization of the fact that I am nature itself, the most beautiful gift of all creation.

                The third movement once again amplifies the triumphant nature of the second movement. Filled with joyful, yet supremely virtuosic passages, the third movement never fails to leave a smile on my face. It becomes a celebration; a celebration of victory and an ode to the human spirit. From the virtuosic and complex passages - a representation of the tumultuous human soul - to the beautiful and majestic strings - another representation of human creation and nature.A beautiful conversation ensues between the orchestra and the piano, a dialogue filled with joy and love.The piano sometimes moves around tender passages, sometimes dances to zealous and energetic passages along with the orchestra with it's own heart filling melodies.They unite for a climactic, joyful, and thrilling conclusion that radiates a jubilant spirit to the listener which leaves an unforgettable mark on the soul of all who take part on this journey.

                Schopenhauer said that art had the ability to transcend the will to life, a force within all of us that is the source of our suffering and desires. In contrast to the never-ending hunger of desires caused by the will to life, art helped us transcend it and truly introspect the human condition and nature. For him, the arts help us to be free from the will and truly grasp reality, something beyond the reach of everyday life. Similarly, Nietzsche saw art as a way to truly reach the indescribable depth of human nature and emotion - the Dionysian element. For him, the arts helped unlock this pure and life-affirming energy that helped confront the suffering and contradictions of life. For Nietzsche, art was the celebration of the Dionysian spirit and a form of transcendence.
